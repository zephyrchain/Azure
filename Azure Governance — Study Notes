## üóÇÔ∏è Azure Governance Hierarchy

Azure governance is structured hierarchically to ensure scalable control and compliance across environments.

### **Core Governance Layers**  
- **Management Groups** ‚Äì Aggregate multiple subscriptions; ideal for enterprise-level access and policy control.  
- **Subscriptions** ‚Äì Boundary for billing, quotas, and isolated access management.  
- **Resource Groups** ‚Äì Logical containers for grouping and managing related resources.  
- **Resources** ‚Äì Individual Azure services (e.g., VMs, storage, web apps).

### **Scope and Inheritance**  
- Governance artifacts‚Äî**RBAC**, **Policies**, and **Locks**‚Äîare inherited downward through this hierarchy.  
- Supports up to **6 levels of nested Management Groups**, allowing structured delegation and compliance propagation.

---

## üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC ensures secure access by assigning roles to users, groups, or identities.

### **Roles and Permissions**  
- Predefined roles include: `Owner`, `Contributor`, and `Reader`.  
- Custom roles enable fine-tuned access control aligned to business needs.

### **Assignment and Scope**  
- Can be scoped to:  
  - **Management Group**  
  - **Subscription**  
  - **Resource Group**  
  - **Resource**  
- Assignments are inherited through the hierarchy unless overridden.

### **Principals and Least Privilege**  
- Applies to **users**, **groups**, and **service principals**.  
- **Follow the Least Privilege** principle to minimize access exposure.

---

## üìù Azure Policy

Azure Policy governs resource compliance by enforcing rules at the control plane level.

### **Audit vs. Enforcement**  
- Start with `Audit` to review impact non-intrusively.  
- Move to `Deny` for strict enforcement once policies are validated.

### **Policy Structure**  
- Built using `if` conditions and `effects`, targeting resource attributes via **aliases**.  
- Common **effects** include:  
  - `Disabled` ‚Äì No enforcement  
  - `Audit` ‚Äì Log non-compliance  
  - `Deny` ‚Äì Prevent resource changes  
  - `Append` / `Modify` ‚Äì Add or alter resource properties  
  - `DeployIfNotExists` ‚Äì Deploy missing configurations  
  - `AuditIfNotExists` ‚Äì Log missing configurations

### **Policy Management**  
- **Definitions** ‚Äì Use built-in or custom policies.  
- **Initiatives** ‚Äì Group policies to track compliance (e.g., **PCI DSS**, **FedRAMP**, **NIST**).  
- **Assignments** ‚Äì Apply policies across scopes with **exclusions** and **exemptions** for mitigated or waived resources.

## üí∞ Cost Management & Optimization

Cost governance tools help analyze, forecast, and control Azure spending.

### **Cost Analysis & Insights**  
- Smart views powered by ML for spending patterns.  
- Filter by **tags**, **subscriptions**, and **resource groups**.  
- Export data for external analysis.

### **Budgets & Triggers**  
- Set budgets at **Management Group**, **Subscription**, or **Resource Group** scope.  
- Enable actions based on thresholds:  
  - **Email Alerts**  
  - **Webhooks**  
  - **Azure Functions**

### **Tag Inheritance**  
- Tags do not inherit by default; must be explicitly enabled for billing.  
- Tag inheritance enables cost tracking from parent scopes.

### **Cost Allocation Strategies**  
- Shared cost distribution options:  
  - **Even split**  
  - **Custom percentages**  
  - **Proportional to spend**

### **Optimization Techniques**  
- Use **Azure Pricing Calculator** and **Azure Advisor**.  
- Save via:  
  - **Reservations** (1 or 3 year)  
  - **Savings Plans**  
  - **Azure Hybrid Benefit** (reuse Windows/SQL licenses)  
  - **Serverless architectures and autoscaling**  
  - **On-Demand Capacity Reservations** for guaranteed availability

## üí° Azure Advisor

Azure Advisor provides personalized recommendations to optimize workloads.

### **Advisor Score**  
- Evaluates optimization across:  
  - **Cost**  
  - **Security**  
  - **Reliability**  
  - **Operational Excellence**  
  - **Performance**

### **Recommendations Overview**  
- **Cost** ‚Äì Right-size VMs, purchase Reservations, identify unused resources.  
- **Security** ‚Äì Strengthen posture (e.g., enable Defender).  
- **Reliability** ‚Äì Enhance high availability and disaster recovery.  
- **Operational Excellence** ‚Äì Improve tagging, monitoring, and automation.  
- **Performance** ‚Äì Suggest infrastructure upgrades and configuration tweaks.

### **Notification & Alerting**  
- Setup **Action Groups** to receive alerts through:  
  - Email  
  - ITSM integrations  
  - Automation tools  
- Generate periodic digests for summarizing recommendations.

### **Assessments**  
- Walk-through tools help identify weaknesses and guide remediation plans.

## üîç Resource Configuration Change (RCC)

RCC, powered by **Azure Resource Graph**, tracks changes to resource properties.

### **Key Features**  
- Logs:  
  - **Who** made the change  
  - **What** tool was used (e.g. Portal, CLI)  
  - **What** operation was performed  
  - **Before/after** state of properties  
- Retention:  
  - 14-day default history  
  - Exportable to **Log Analytics** for extended tracking

### **Use Cases**  
- Debug stability issues from misconfigurations  
- Audit resource changes for governance reporting  
- Enhance transparency for internal or external compliance reviews

---

## üì¶ Deployment Stacks

Deployment Stacks replace Blueprints and support structured resource lifecycle management.

### **Capabilities**  
- Group logically related resources‚Äîeven across multiple subscriptions or resource groups.  
- Enable lifecycle actions: **deploy**, **update**, **delete** together.

### **Deny Settings & Exclusions**  
- Use with ARM or **Bicep** templates.  
- Apply **deny policies** to restrict modification/deletion.  
- Configure **exclusions** for specific users or operations.

### **Deployment Scope**  
- Can be assigned to:  
  - **Management Groups**  
  - **Subscriptions**  
  - **Resource Groups**  
- Resources must reside within the stack‚Äôs defined scope.

### **Capabilities**  
- Query across multiple subscriptions using **KQL** (Kusto Query Language).  
- Interface options:  
  - Azure Portal  
  - PowerShell  
  - CLI  
- Fast queries with support for large-scale environments.  
- **Read-only**‚Äîideal for auditing, not resource changes.
