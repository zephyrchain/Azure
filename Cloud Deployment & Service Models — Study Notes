## 🚀 Cloud Deployment Models

### **Private Cloud**
- Operated solely for a single organization, managed internally or by a third party  
- Greater control and customization  
- Requires significant capital expenditure  

### **Public Cloud**
- Provided by third-party vendors over the public internet  
- Highly scalable, cost-effective, low maintenance  

### **Community Cloud**
- Shared infrastructure among organizations with common concerns  
- Cost-effective for groups with shared compliance needs  

### **Hybrid Cloud**
- Combines private and public cloud environments  
- Facilitates flexibility, security, and compliance

## 🧩 Cloud Service Models

### **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
- Virtualized computing resources over the internet  
- You manage OS, applications, and middleware  
- Provider handles the underlying infrastructure  

### **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
- Develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure  
- You focus on development; provider manages platform  

### **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
- Software delivered over the internet via subscription  
- Accessible via web browser; provider manages everything

## 📐 NIST Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- On-demand self-service  
- Broad network access  
- Resource pooling  
- Rapid elasticity  
- Measured service

## ☁️ When to Use Public Cloud

- Predictable bursting (e.g., holiday seasons)  
- Startup scaling (e.g., launching a new app)  
- Unpredictable bursting (e.g., breaking news traffic)  
- Seasonal workloads (e.g., tax season)  
- Disaster recovery (e.g., backup solutions)  
- DMZ/public-facing applications  
- Global deployment needs  
- Special projects with short-term lifecycles
