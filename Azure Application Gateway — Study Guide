## 1️⃣ Introduction

Azure Application Gateway is a **Layer 7 (Application Layer)** load balancer that manages and distributes traffic to your web services with deep packet inspection and protocol-level intelligence.

## 2️⃣ Deployment & Configuration

### 📡 Virtual Network & Subnet

- Must deploy App Gateway into a **virtual network**.
- Required subnet:
  - **V1**: `/26` (up to 32 instances)
  - **V2**: `/24` (up to 125 instances)
- Subnet name is user-defined (e.g., `gateway-subnet`).

### 🆚 Versions Overview

|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Cost Model        | Size-based fixed cost + data      | Time-based fixed + capacity unit charges  |
| Auto-scaling      | ❌                                | ✅                                       |

## 3️⃣ Key Features

### 🧠 Layer 7 Capabilities

- **URL Redirection** – Redirect requests to different destinations.
- **URL-Based Routing** – Route based on URL paths (`/blog`, `/store`, etc.).
- **Rewrite Rules** – Modify headers, cookies, query strings.
- **SSL/TLS Termination** – Offload SSL to gateway and forward decrypted traffic.
- **Session Affinity** – Cookie-based session stickiness.
- **Connection Draining** – Allow graceful backend member removal.

### 🚀 V2 Enhancements

- **Auto-Scaling**
- **Availability Zones**
- **Static Frontend VIPs**
- **Header Rewrite**
- **WAF Custom Rules**

## 4️⃣ Architecture & Workflow

### 🖥️ Backend Pools

Can include:
- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
- App Services
- IP Addresses (public/private/on-prem)
- Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs)

🔸 Note: Backend pool members can span regions, but the App Gateway itself is regional.

### 🌐 Frontend IPs

- Always includes a **Public IP**
- Optionally includes a **Private IP**
- V2 supports **Static VIPs**
- DNS name persists for App Gateway’s lifecycle

### 🔉 Listeners

Define how incoming traffic is received:

- **Basic Listener** – IP, port, protocol-based
- **Multi-site Listener** – Uses host headers to differentiate (e.g., `contoso.com`, `fabrique.io`)

### ⚙️ Rules

- **Basic Rule** – Direct traffic to one backend
- **Path-Based Rule** – Route based on URL paths
- **Redirection Rule** – Redirect to listener or external site (e.g., HTTP → HTTPS)

### ✏️ Rewrite Rules

Used to modify:
- Request/response headers
- Cookies
- URLs
- Query strings

### 📑 HTTP Settings

- **Re-encryption**
- **Cookie-Based Affinity**
- **Connection Draining**
- **Health Probes**

## 5️⃣ Integration with AKS

Azure App Gateway can serve as an **Ingress Controller** for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### 🔌 Networking Models

| Model     | Description                                                                    |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CNI**   | Pods receive valid VNet IPs; direct communication with App Gateway             |
| **Kubenet** | Pods use isolated IPs; requires route table config to forward traffic        |

### ⚙️ How Integration Works

1. Ingress Controller is deployed as a pod inside the AKS cluster.
2. It watches the Kubernetes API for service/pod changes.
3. Updates App Gateway config via ARM.
4. Routes traffic to updated backend pods accordingly.
