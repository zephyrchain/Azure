# 🔑 Identity in Microsoft Azure — Study Notes

These notes are designed as a quick-reference companion for reviewing Azure identity and access management concepts, inspired by John Savill’s expert training series.

---

## 🔐 Introduction to Identity
- Identity is the new security perimeter in cloud computing.  
- Cloud environments secure resources through identity-based permissions rather than firewalls.  
- Educating users on threat detection is vital for preserving a secure environment.  

---

## 🛡️ Need for Identity
- Different identities require tailored access levels.  
- Principle of least privilege ensures each identity has only the permissions needed.  
- Minimizes the risk of accidental or deliberate misuse.  

---

## ⚙️ Identity Basics
- Permissions are grouped into roles assigned to identities within a defined scope.  
- Identities can represent humans, applications, devices, and services.  
- Each identity type requires appropriate access controls and policies.  

---

## 🌐 Decentralized Identity
- Shifts control from centralized providers to individual users.  
- Users own their identity data and share verifiable credentials issued by trusted authorities.  
- Enhances privacy and reduces single points of failure.  

---

## 🔑 Entra ID Overview
- Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) is Microsoft’s enterprise identity provider.  
- Centralizes identity for Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 within a tenant.  
- Tenants contain users, groups, devices, and policies; custom domains can be added.  

---

## 🧩 Entra ID Objects
- **Users**: Individual human accounts with unique credentials.  
- **Groups**: Collections of identities for bulk permission assignment.  
- **Service Principals**: Application identities for automation and services.  
- **Managed Identities**: Special service principals bound to Azure resources.  
- **Devices**: Registered, joined, or hybrid-joined for device-based access controls.  

---

## 🔄 Synchronization
- Sync between on-premises Active Directory and Entra ID maintains consistent identity data.  
- Tools like Entra Connect Sync and Entra Cloud Sync enable one-way sync (AD → Entra ID) with limited write-back.  
- Supports multiple AD forests syncing to a single Entra ID tenant.  

---

## 🔒 Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication** proves identity via something you know (password), have (phone), or are (biometric).  
- **Authorization** grants permissions based on an authenticated identity’s roles.  
- Common methods include password-hash sync, pass-through authentication, and federation.  

---

## 🏷️ Roles & Administrative Units
- **Roles** bundle permissions for assignment to identities.  
- **Administrative Units** scope roles to specific subsets of users, groups, or devices.  
- Custom roles (up to 100 per tenant) enable granular permission definitions.  

---

## 🛡️ Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Provides just-in-time privileged access with approval workflows.  
- Assignments are time-bound, reducing standing privileges.  
- Enhances security by ensuring elevated access only when needed.  

---

## 🌍 Entra Permissions Management
- On-demand, ad-hoc permission governance across Azure, AWS, and GCP.  
- Helps right-size permissions and remove unused access for least-privilege enforcement.  

---

## 🔍 Access Reviews
- Automates recurring reviews of group memberships, app assignments, and role assignments.  
- Prevents permission creep and ensures ongoing compliance.  

---

## 🔑 Multifactor & Strong Authentication
- MFA requires two or more factors (password, phone, biometric).  
- Strong methods like FIDO2, passkeys, and Temporary Access Passes (TAP) offer phishing-resistant, passwordless security.  

---

## 🛂 Conditional Access
- Policy engine enforcing controls based on user, location, device, and risk signals.  
- Evaluated during authentication and token issuance for context-driven protection.  

---

## 🤝 B2B & External ID
- **B2B** enables partner collaboration using their existing identities.  
- **External ID** manages customer identities via social or custom SAML/OIDC providers for seamless UX.  

---

## 📦 Entitlement Management & Workflows
- **Access Packages** bundle groups, apps, and roles with defined policies.  
- Workflow policies govern request approvals and lifecycle tasks for onboarding/offboarding.  

---

## 🌐 Internet & Private Access
- Secure Service Edge (SSE) secures both internet and private network resources.  
- Private Access uses connectors for protected network reachability.  
- Internet Access applies security profiles to web traffic based on policies.  

---

## 🏛️ Active Directory in Azure
- Azure AD Domain Services delivers managed domain services for hybrid environments.  
- JsonADDomainExtension automates VM domain join, simplifying management and enhancing security.
