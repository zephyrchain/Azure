# 🛣️ Azure ExpressRoute — Study Guide  

A structured overview inspired by John Savill’s session: [Azure ExpressRoute Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oevwZZ1YFS0)

## 🌍 Azure Global Network

Azure operates one of the world’s largest cloud networks, powered by extensive fiber infrastructure and global peering relationships.

- Connects Azure regions via a high-speed, low-latency backbone  
- Facilitates internal and external traffic routing with reliability  
- Defines regional latency zones (≈2ms round-trip boundaries)

---

## 🏙️ Regions & Redundant Gateways

Azure regions are connected through **redundant regional network gateways**, enhancing:

- **Resiliency** – Multiple paths prevent single points of failure  
- **Performance** – Optimized entry/exit points to backbone infrastructure

---

## 🏗️ Edge Nodes & Peering Facilities

Edge nodes extend Azure into **carrier-neutral locations**, improving:

- **Connectivity** – Reduced hops to reach Azure via local carriers  
- **Interoperability** – More choices for telecom providers  
- **Efficiency** – Faster routes to public and private Azure services

---

## 🔗 Connectivity Models

| Type             | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Point-to-Point** | Direct physical connection (e.g., fiber) to Azure               |
| **Any-to-Any**     | MPLS-based mesh connectivity across multiple on-prem locations  |

---

## 🧩 ExpressRoute Circuits

ExpressRoute circuits define the physical/logical connection to Azure.

### 🆚 SKU Comparison

| SKU        | Capabilities                                                                 |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard** | Connectivity within a geopolitical boundary (e.g., North America)          |
| **Premium**  | Cross-boundary access + **Microsoft 365**, global reach, expanded routing  |

---

## 🚀 ExpressRoute Direct

For customers needing **ultra-high bandwidth** and reduced third-party dependence:

- Connect directly to Microsoft’s edge routers  
- Available in **10 Gbps or 100 Gbps ports**  
- Avoids service provider middle layers for **enhanced security**

---

## 🔄 Peering Types

| Type              | Description                                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Microsoft Peering** | Access Microsoft’s public services over ExpressRoute (e.g., Storage, SQL) |
| **Private Peering**   | Extend on-prem to Azure VNets using virtual network gateways              |

---

## 🔧 Microsoft Peering Requirements

To enable Microsoft peering, you must provide:

- **Public IP ranges** (e.g., `/29`, `/30`)  
- **ASN** (Autonomous System Number) for routing identity  
- **Route filters** to limit exposed Azure services and regions

---

## 🔐 Private Peering Considerations

Private peering requires:

- **ExpressRoute Gateway** in each connected virtual network  
- **Multi-VNet Support** — multiple VNets can share a circuit  
- Careful attention to **gateway size/capacity** and **latency boundaries**

---

## 🔁 Routing Optimizations & Resiliency

Optimize ExpressRoute behavior through:

### 🧠 BGP Communities

- Annotate routes with region/service metadata  
- Useful for policy-based traffic steering

### 🎯 Local Preference

- Influence route decisions to favor **closer circuits**  
- Enhances performance in multi-circuit environments

---

## 🌐 ExpressRoute Global Reach

Global Reach enables private connectivity **between on-prem sites** across different regions:

- Leverages Microsoft’s backbone as a transit path  
- Enables backup/failover options between corporate locations  
- Cost-effective alternative to full mesh MPLS deployments

---

## ✅ Summary & Key Takeaways

- Azure ExpressRoute provides **dedicated, private, high-bandwidth** connectivity  
- Supports both **public (Microsoft Peering)** and **private (VNet) access**  
- Premium offerings allow **global access** and **enhanced scalability**  
- Routing control, BGP customization, and diagnostic visibility ensure resilience  
- **Global Reach** turns Azure into a **private backbone** for inter-site traffic
